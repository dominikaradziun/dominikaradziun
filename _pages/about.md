I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Brain, Body, and Technology Lab](https://www.brainbodytech.com/) at the Donders Institute, Radboud University, where I explore how our brain's perception of the body can be reshaped by various factors, including the tools we use. My research involves behavioral studies, neuroimaging, and computational models to uncover how the brain adapts when its boundaries are pushed.

I earned my PhD from Karolinska Institutet, focusing on body perception and brain plasticity in both blind and sighted individuals. My doctoral thesis was honored with the [Glushko Dissertation Prize](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/glushko-dissertation-prize/) from the Cognitive Science Society.

My academic journey has taken me from Poland to Norway, Sweden, the UK, and now the Netherlands, driven by a passion for understanding the flexibility of our brains. As a scientist, I feel privileged to ask big questions and mentor students as they grow into researchers themselves.
